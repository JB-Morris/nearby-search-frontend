# nearby-search-frontend
In order to run this program, a ".env" file must be created containing an API key with which to access the Nearby Search API. An example will be included below.
VITE_NEARBY_SEARCH_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]

Additionally, a CORS plugin will be necessary to allow the browser to access the Nearby Search API. Personally, I went with this one using the Chrome browser: https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html?v=0.1.8&type=install


To run, use the console command "npm run dev"
